# BoostWeapon Plugin

BoostWeapon is a Minecraft Paper plugin for version 1.20.4 that adds custom crafting recipes to create unique weapons. Originally designed for my Minecraft server, the Boost SMP, it is now being publicly released for all to enjoy. While it complements the Boost plugin (also developed by me), it does not depend on it to function.

**Please note:** This plugin is provided as-is, and no official support will be offered for future compatibility with newer paper versions and plugin errors.

## Features

- **Custom Crafting Recipes**: Craft powerful weapons with unique abilities.
- **Custom Commands**: Quickly access custom weapons or view plugin credits.
- **Standalone**: Works independently of the Boost plugin.

## Custom Weapons and items

### 1. Harpoon Gun
- **Ability**: Grants a grappling ability to pull the player towards a target location where they are looking.
- **Crafting Recipe**: Middle slot in the imgur image crafting grid. Also requires a trident in the players inventory along with the Harpoon Gun item to work.

### 2. Sonic Bow
- **Ability**: Fires arrows that deal the Warden's sonic boom attack upon landing.
- **Crafting Recipe**: Far left in the imgur image crafting grid.

### 3. Broadsword
- **Ability**: Inflicts massive damage but features a slow recharge rate and allows for a small dash ability which launches you a short disance.
- **Crafting Recipe**: Far right in imgur image crafting grid.

### 4. Supercharge
- **Ability**: Grants the player Strength III, Slowness IV, and a glowing effect for 2 minutes.
